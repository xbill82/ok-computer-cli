This project is an oclif CLI. Let's generate a new command called `hours`.
This command's aim is the compute the amount of hours I have spent on each epic of my projects.

The command will take a query as the input argument, which will be a string that describes the epic, as well as a date range.

The command will then fetch the events from my Google Calendar and compute the sum of the duration of the events (within the date range)
that contain the epic name in their title.

The command will then print the result in a human readable format.

To implement this, you can use the Google Calendar API, so install the needed dependencies.
Also, tell me what I need to do to get the Google Calendar API working.
Of course, create the necessary files and folders.
